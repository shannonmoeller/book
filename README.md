Allows bookmarks to be hosted by GitHub and accessed like a command-line program from the address bar. Just add the following as a keyworded bookmarklet in Firefox, or as a custom search engine in Google Chrome:

    javascript:(function(a){a.body.appendChild(a.createElement('script')).src='http://shannonmoeller.github.com/book/book.js?%s';}(document));
